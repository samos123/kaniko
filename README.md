# kaniko - Build Images In Kubernetes

kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster.

kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command within a Dockerfile completely in userspace.
This enables building container images in environments that can't easily or securely run a Docker daemon, such as a standard Kubernetes cluster. 

We're currently in the process of building kaniko, so as of now it isn't production ready.
Please let us know if you have any feature requests or find any bugs!

### How does kaniko work?

The kaniko executor image is responsible for building an image from a Dockerfile and pushing it to a registry.
Within the executor image, we extract the filesystem of the base image (the FROM image in the Dockerfile).
We then execute the commands in the Dockerfile, snapshotting the filesystem in userspace after each one.
After each command, we append a layer of changed files to the base image (if there are any) and update image metadata.

### Known Issues

The majority of Dockerfile commands can be executed with kaniko, but we're still working on supporting the following commands:

* SHELL
* HEALTHCHECK
* STOPSIGNAL
* ARG

Multi-Stage Dockerfiles are also unsupported currently, but will be ready soon.

kaniko also does not support building Windows containers.

## Development
### kaniko Build Contexts
kaniko supports local directories and GCS buckets as build contexts. To specify a local directory, pass in the `--context` flag as an argument to the executor image.
To specify a GCS bucket, pass in the `--bucket` flag.
The GCS bucket should contain a compressed tar of the build context called `context.tar.gz`, which kaniko will unpack and use as the build context. 

To create `context.tar.gz`, run the following command:
```shell
tar -C <path to build context> -zcvf context.tar.gz .
```

Or, you can use [skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold) to create `context.tar.gz` by running
```
skaffold docker context
```

We can copy over the compressed tar to a GCS bucket with gsutil:

```
gsutil cp context.tar.gz gs://<bucket name>
```

### Running kaniko in a Kubernetes cluster

Requirements:
* Standard Kubernetes cluster
* Kubernetes Secret

To run kaniko in a Kubernetes cluster, you will need a standard running Kubernetes cluster and a Kubernetes secret, which contains the auth required to push the final image. 

To create the secret, first you will need to create a service account in the Google Cloud Console project you want to push the final image to, with `Storage Admin` permissions.
You can download a JSON key for this service account, and rename it `kaniko-secret.json`.
To create the secret, run:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic kaniko-secret --from-file=<path to kaniko-secret.json>
```

The Kubernetes Pod spec should look similar to this, with the args parameters filled in:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kaniko
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kaniko
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
    args: ["--dockerfile=<path to Dockerfile>",
            "--bucket=<GCS bucket>",
            "--destination=<gcr.io/$PROJECT/$IMAGE:$TAG>"]
    volumeMounts:
      - name: kaniko-secret
        mountPath: /secret
    env:
      - name: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
        value: /secret/kaniko-secret.json
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: kaniko-secret
      secret:
        secretName: kaniko-secret
```

This example pulls the build context from a GCS bucket.
To use a local directory build context, you could consider using configMaps to mount in small build contexts.

### Running kaniko in Google Container Builder 
To run kaniko in GCB, add it to your build config as a build step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
    args: ["--dockerfile=<path to Dockerfile>",
           "--context=<path to build context>",
           "--destination=<gcr.io/$PROJECT/$IMAGE:$TAG>"]
```
kaniko will build and push the final image in this build step.

### Running kaniko locally

Requirements:
* Docker
* gcloud

We can run the kaniko executor image locally in a Docker daemon to build and push an image from a Dockerfile.

First, we want to load the executor image into the Docker daemon by running
```shell
make images
```

To run kaniko in Docker, run the following command:
```shell
./run_in_docker.sh <path to Dockerfile> <path to build context> <destination of final image>
```
### Pushing to Different Registries

kaniko uses Docker credential helpers to push images to a registry.

kaniko comes with support for GCR, but configuring another credential helper should allow pushing to a different registry.

### Debug Image

We provide `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:debug` as a a version of the executor image based off a Debian image. 
This provides a shell and can be useful for debugging.

## Security
 
kaniko by itself **does not** make it safe to run untrusted builds inside your cluster, or anywhere else.
 
kaniko relies on the security features of your container runtime to provide build security.
 
The minimum permissions kaniko needs inside your container are governed by a few things:
 
* The permissions required to unpack your base image into it's container
* The permissions required to execute the RUN commands inside the container
 
If you have a minimal base image (SCRATCH or similar) that doesn't require permissions to unpack, and your Dockerfile doesn't execute any commands as the root user,
you can run Kaniko without root permissions.

You may be able to achieve the same default seccomp profile that Docker uses in your Pod by setting [seccomp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#seccomp) profiles with annotations on a [PodSecurityPolicy](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-security-policies) to create or update security policies on your cluster.

## Comparison with Other Tools

Similar tools include:
* [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img)
* [orca-build](https://github.com/cyphar/orca-build)
* [buildah](https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah)
* [FTL](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/runtimes-common/tree/master/ftl)
* [Bazel rules_docker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker)

All of these tools build container images with different approaches.

`img` can perform as a non root user from within a container, but requires that the `img` container has `RawProc` access to create nested containers.
`kaniko` does not actually create nested containers, so it does not require `RawProc` access.

`orca-build` depends on `runC` to build images from Dockerfiles, which can not run inside a container. `kaniko` doesn't use runC so it doesn't require the use of kernel namespacing techniques.

`buildah` requires the same privileges as a Docker daemon does to run, while `kaniko` runs without any special privileges or permissions.  

`FTL` and `Bazel` aim to achieve the fastest possible creation of Docker images for a subset of images.
These can be thought of as a special-case "fast path" that can be used in conjunction with the support for general Dockerfiles kaniko provides.
